" the best explanation about tab in vim I have seen is http://tedlogan.com/techblog3.html
set expandtab        " in Insert mode: Use the appropriate number of spaces to insert a <Tab>.
set tabstop=4        " number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for
set shiftwidth=4     " number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent
set softtabstop=4	" number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while performing editing operations
let g:autopep8_indent_size=4
